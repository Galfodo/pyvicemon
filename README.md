# pyvicemon
Remote machine language monitor for the VICE C64 emulator, implemented in Python

Connects to a running VICE instance (started with -binarymonitor) on 6502@127.0.0.1

When used from a Python script or interactive session, the various debugging functions 
(e.g `set_breakpoint()`, `wait_for_debugger_event()`, `read_memory()`, `write_memory()`, `load_file()`
`save_file()`, etc.) can be used for complex debugging scenarios and capturing state in an automated
fashion.

## Files:
* vice_monitor.py - The monitor program
* miniasm6502.py - Standalone interactive assembler + disassembler, used by the monitor

## Command line arguments:
```
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SESSION, --session SESSION
                        Playback session
  -r RECORD, --record RECORD
                        Record session to file.
